# Introduction

This is a pattern library that will be used for Contorion. If you see
a component on the website of [Contorion](contorion.de) then this should
be available here as well.


The easiest way to navigate these components is through the left
navigation list. The components also hold the code that goes along with
it. So it is easier to create these components for the developers using
them.

We are using the power and syntax of
[FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) for our icons. You
can check their documentation for the proper usage of specific icons.

If a component is not there or if the component has a mistake in it,
 please contact [Gary](gary.fleischer@contorion.de)
